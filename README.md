# Tip calculator

Simple static tip calculator built with HTML/CSS/JS.

Features:

- Enter bill amount, choose a preset tip or enter a custom percentage.
- Set number of people splitting the bill.
- Shows tip amount per person and total per person.
- Reset button clears inputs.

How to open locally (Windows PowerShell):

1. Open PowerShell in this folder (or change directory):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Lenovo\OneDrive\Desktop\projects\Tip calculator"
```

2. You can open `index.html` directly in a browser (double-click), or run a simple static server.

If you have Python 3 installed, run:

```powershell
py -3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

That's it â€” the calculator is static and requires no build steps.
